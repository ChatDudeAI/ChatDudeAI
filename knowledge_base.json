            "question": "How Does the Strong AI Differ From the Weak AI?",
            "answer": "The goal of strong artificial intelligence is to create actual intelligence artificially, which refers to an intellect created by humans that possesses feelings, consciousness, and emotions comparable to those of humans. The idea of creating AI entities with perceiving, analyzing, and decision-making skills comparable to those of humans is still only an assumption at this point. The present phase of artificial intelligence research is known as \u201cweak AI\u201d and it is concerned with the construction of expert systems and robots that can assist people and solve challenging real-world issues. Weak artificial intelligence systems like Alexa, Siri And ChatDudeAi are examples."

            "question": " What Do You Comprehend by the Phrase \u201cReward Maximization\u201d?",
            "answer": "Reinforcement learning uses the phrase \u201creward maximization\u201d to describe the purpose of the agent, which is to maximize rewards. Real-world rewards are positive feedback for doing an action that results in a change in a state. A reward is given to the agent if he uses optimum policies to complete a good deed, and a reward is deducted if he fails to do so. Rewards are maximized by using the best rules possible, which is known as reward maximization."

They are made known in advance. Algorithm hyperparameters that have no influence on simulation results but can influence the efficiency and acquisition of skills are the other two categories of hyperparameters that may be inferred when accommodating the machine to the learning algorithm."

            "question": "What is the Difference Between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?",
            "answer": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) are related but distinct fields of study. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field that encompasses a variety of techniques and approaches for creating intelligent systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing speech, and making decisions. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable systems to improve their performance over time by learning from data. Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into three main categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that involves the use of neural networks, a type of model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, to learn from data. Deep learning techniques are particularly well-suited for tasks such as image and speech recognition, and are often used in natural language processing and computer vision applications. In summary, AI is the broad field of creating intelligent systems, ML is a subset of AI that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions, and DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks to learn from data."

            "question": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms.",
            "answer": "Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum bits, or qubits, instead of the binary bits used in traditional computing. While traditional bits can only be in either a 0 or 1 state, qubits can exist in a superposition of both states at the same time. This means that a quantum computer can perform certain calculations much faster than a traditional computer, especially for tasks that involve complex simulations or searching large databases. Additionally, quantum computers can use a phenomenon called entanglement, where two qubits can become linked in such a way that the state of one affects the state of the other, to perform certain types of calculations even faster. However, quantum computing is still a relatively new field, and developing practical quantum computers with enough qubits and stability to be useful for most applications is still a significant challenge."
